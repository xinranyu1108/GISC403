	<!-- EDIT THE DESCRIPTION HERE -->
This interactive web map showcases the key locations that define my daily routine in Christchurch. Each point represents a place of personal or professional significance, from my workplace to the gym, university, and regular supermarket. The design is focused on simplicity and clarity. I've chosen a light beige color for the base map to create a neutral background, ensuring other elements stand out. Text sizes for important areas like suburbs have been enlarged for easy navigation. The paths of my daily activities are highlighted in a contrasting color to draw immediate attention. In maintaining visual coherence, a uniform color theme is used for important features.  Lastly, the territorial boundaries are subtly indicated in a color similar to the background, with high opacity, but are delineated with a distinct black outline. This approach ensures that they are noticeable without overshadowing the details of the map.
