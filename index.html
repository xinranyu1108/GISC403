This interactive web map showcases the key locations that shape my daily routine in Christchurch. The locations I frequently visit, such as my workplace, gym, university, and supermarket, are uniformly highlighted and interconnected in a consistent color for straightforward recognition. In contrast, the Christchurch Gondola, a destination I go to occasionally, is distinctly marked in orange and linked with a dashed line, setting it apart from my regular spots. To emphasize simplicity and clarity, I've tailored the base map by deactivating specific layers from Mapbox and modifying the colors of roads and land areas to a light tone. This creates a neutral background that allows other elements to be more prominent. The text sizes for suburbs have been enlarged, improving ease of reference and navigation. Main features such as paths, polygons, and pop-up texts are illustrated in contrasting colors to capture immediate attention. Finally, territorial boundaries are subtly delineated with a high opacity shade close to the background color, outlined in black, ensuring they are visible but do not overwhelm the map's finer details.
